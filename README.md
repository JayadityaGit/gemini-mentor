# Gemini Mentor (still in experimental stage) 🎓


Turns Gemini-Cli into a Socratic coding mentor. It guides you to solutions instead of writing code for you.

## Installation

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/JayadityaGit/gemini-mentor
```

## Usage

- **/mentor [topic]**: Activate Mentor Mode. You can optionally provide a topic to start with.
  - _Example_: `/mentor I want to fix a bug in the login flow`
- **/byementor**: Exit Mentor Mode. Returns to normal assistant behavior.

## Features

- **No-Code Solutions**: Forces you to think and write the code yourself.
- **Codebase Sherpa**: Teaches navigation and debugging skills.
- **Pre-flight Check**: Verifies you know the project's tech stack before starting.
